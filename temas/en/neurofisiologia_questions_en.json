        "Excess energy",
        "Psychotic disorders or coma",
        "Mental stabilization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When neurons suffer from a lack of glucose due to insufficient blood supply, mental functions are severely disturbed, which can manifest in the form of mental imbalances, the appearance of psychotic disorders, and can even progress to coma."

      "question": "What system does the sympathetic chain belong to?",
      "options": [
        "Somatic",
        "Parasympathetic",
        "Enteric",
        "Autonomous"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic chain, also known as the ganglionic chain, constitutes a central element of the autonomic or vegetative nervous system, specifically responsible for the sympathetic division that mediates involuntary emergency or stress responses in the body."

      "question": "What fibers are found in the gray communicating branch?",
      "options": [
        "Preganglionic sensory",
        "Postganglionic parasympathetic",
        "Somatic motor",
        "postganglionic sympathetic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The postganglionic fibers, once they have synapsed in the ganglia of the sympathetic chain, return to the spinal nerve through the gray ramus communicans and then distribute to blood vessels, sweat glands and piloerector muscles."

    {
      "question": "What structure connect the white communicating branches?",
      "options": [
        "Medulla with peripheral ganglia",
        "chain ganglia to each other",
        "Ventral root with dorsal root",
        "Spinal nerve with sympathetic chain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The white communicating branch is the connection point that allows the transfer of preganglionic sympathetic fibers from the trunk of the spinal nerve to the ganglia of the sympathetic chain for their subsequent synapse, being the entry route to the sympathetic system."

      "question": "Who consumes more energy per unit of mass?",
      "options": [
        "Schwann cells",
        "Astrocytes",
        "Oligodendrocytes",
        "Neurons"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The neuronal component of the nervous tissue is the one that presents the most intense metabolic consumption compared to the supporting glial cells, which reflects the enormous amount of energy required for the constant electrical activity and transport of ions through their membranes."

      "question": "Why does glucose diffuse freely to neurons?",

        "Allows insulin synthesis",
        "Ensures mental functions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The fact that glucose can diffuse freely into neurons is a fundamental safety mechanism that guarantees a constant energy supply to the brain, which is vital to keep mental functions unchanged even under conditions of insulin deficiency, as occurs in severe diabetes."

      "question": "Where do postganglionic fibers go?",
      "options": [
        "Towards its effector endings",
        "Towards the digestive tract",
        "Towards the sympathetic chain",
        "Towards the peripheral ganglion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The postganglionic fibers, originating in the chain or in peripheral ganglia, have as their final destination the organs, glands or structures where they will release neurotransmitters to modulate their function, thus completing the sympathetic pathway towards their effector endings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What other route can the preganglionic fiber take in the chain?",
      "options": [
        "Just ascend",
        "Ascend or descend",
        "Make immediate synapse",
        "Back to the core"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "One of the routes that preganglionic fibers can follow is to travel the sympathetic chain in a vertical direction, both ascending and descending, in order to reach and make synapses with postganglionic neurons located in a different ganglion than the initial entry point to the chain."
