        "ventricular muscle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The sinoatrial (SA) node is the normal pacemaker because its rhythmic discharge rate, between 70 and 80 times per minute, is significantly faster than that of any other part of the cardiac conduction system, dominating the overall rhythm."

        "The SA node"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The Purkinje system is essential because its very fast conduction speed guarantees that the cardiac impulse reaches almost all portions of the ventricles practically simultaneously, which is essential for synchronous and effective ventricular contraction of the chambers."

        "Serotonin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerves releases norepinephrine into the nerve endings. This hormone stimulates β1-adrenergic receptors, resulting in a general increase in heart activity, including the rate and force of contraction."

        "Chlorine and sodium"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "It is thought that norepinephrine, by stimulating beta 1-adrenergic receptors, increases the permeability of the fiber membrane to sodium (Na}^+) and calcium (Ca}^{2+) ions. This increase accelerates self-excitation and is responsible for increasing the contractile force of the cardiac muscle."

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Intense stimulation of the vagus nerves can have two effects: it can completely interrupt the rhythmic excitation of the sinus node, or it can completely block the transmission of the cardiac impulse from the atria to the ventricles through the AV node."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Premature depolarization occurs due to an abnormal prolongation of the ventricular action potential, resulting from a significant delay in the repolarization process of cardiac muscle fibers. This alteration in electrical recovery time is the basis of long QT syndrome and its associated arrhythmias."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The phenomenon of paroxysmal tachycardia is considered to be caused by feedback pathways that generate circular reentry movements. This process establishes a repeated and localized self-excitation that allows the irritable focus to become the new pacemaker of the heart."

        "Only in healthy young people"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia is considered a serious condition for two reasons. First, it typically indicates considerable ischemic injury to the ventricles, and second, it is frequently the initial event that triggers ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening arrhythmia."

        "Extends the refractory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Lidocaine exerts its therapeutic effect by reducing the normal increase in the permeability of the cardiac muscle membrane to the sodium ion that occurs during the depolarization phase of the action potential. By doing so, it helps block the abnormal rhythmic impulses that cause tachycardia."

        "ten minutes",
        "One hour"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "After the onset of ventricular fibrillation, loss of consciousness occurs almost immediately, within four to five seconds, due to the absence of cerebral blood flow, as the ventricles stop performing a coordinated and effective contraction."

        "Normal refractory period",
        "smaller heart"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Circular motion or reentry of an impulse occurs if the conduction pathway around the tissue is significantly longer than normal. This allows that, by the time it returns to its point of origin, the muscle has already left its refractory state and can be continuously excited again."
    },
    {
      "question": "What alteration in conduction velocity favors reentry?",
      "options": [
        "Speed ​​increase",

        "Deceleration",
        "Long refractory period"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "A condition that favors reentry is the sufficient decrease in driving speed along the track, even if the length of the track remains constant. This increases the return time of the impulse, ensuring that the muscle is already excitable again, perpetuating the circular movement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the refractory period to be a reentry condition?",
      "options": [
        "It prolongs",
        "It gets a lot shorter",
        "stays the same",
        "It becomes variable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Marked shortening of the refractory period of the cardiac muscle is another factor that can cause reentry or circular motion. A shorter refractory period allows the impulse to return and reexcite the previously excited muscle in a much shorter time than normal, maintaining the arrhythmia."

        "The pace is slow",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Atrial flutter is distinguished from fibrillation because the electrical signal travels as a single large, constant wave in one direction around the atrial muscle mass. In contrast, atrial fibrillation involves multiple small wave fronts that propagate erratically in different directions."

        "Synchronize the muscle",
        "Block the AV node"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The goal of electrical defibrillation is to put the entire ventricular muscle into a refractory period simultaneously by applying a high-voltage electrical current for a fraction of a second. This stops all impulses, allowing the heart's natural pacemaker to restore a normal rhythm."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main reason for performing CPR before late defibrillation?",
      "options": [

        "To reduce the voltage",
        "To reduce hypoxia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed before defibrillation in prolonged cases because the heart may be too weak to be resuscitated due to lack of nutrient delivery due to the absence of coronary blood flow. Manual pumping temporarily replenishes the necessary coronary supply."
