        "wall hypertrophy",
        "Frequency increase"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is a key compensatory mechanism. The cardiac muscle grows in size to counteract the increased workload, either due to greater resistance to blood outflow or due to a greater volume of blood handled."

      "question": "Where does blood flow back in mitral regurgitation?",
      "options": [
        "to the right ventricle",
        "to the left atrium",
        "to the vena cava",
        "to the pericardial sac"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "During systole, the mitral valve does not close completely in regurgitation, allowing a large volume of blood to return from the left ventricle to the left atrium, raising the pressure in this chamber and potentially causing pulmonary congestion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes pulmonary edema in mitral heart disease?",
      "options": [
        "Decrease in diastole",
        "Increased blood pressure",
        "High pressure in left atrium",
        "Rapid ventricular emptying"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Mitral regurgitation or stenosis causes a significant increase in pressure in the left atrium. This elevated pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary veins and capillaries, causing fluid to leak into the lung tissue, which we know as pulmonary edema."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the serious effect of severe valve injuries?",
      "options": [
        "Increased cardiac output",
        "Low lung pressure",
        "Reduction in cardiac output",
        "Decreased breathing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Severe valvular lesions seriously compromise the heart's pumping capacity, either due to resistance to outflow or reflux. This results in a notable decrease in the volume of blood that the heart can expel per minute, known as cardiac output."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the definitive treatment for severe valve injuries?",
      "options": [
        "Immobilization of the patient",
        "Valve repair or replacement",
        "Anti-inflammatory drugs",
        "Low sodium diet"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Management of severe valvular heart disease with hemodynamic involvement generally requires surgical intervention to repair or replace the defective valve with a prosthesis. This is necessary to permanently restore normal blood flow mechanics in the heart."

      "question": "What major factor causes massive vasodilation in anaphylactic shock?",
      "options": [
        "Oxygen reduction",
        "histamine release",
        "cardiac arrest",
        "Increased pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In anaphylactic shock, exposure to an allergen causes the massive release of histamine and other chemical mediators. These compounds act potently as vasodilators, drastically reducing total peripheral resistance and, consequently, blood pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What drugs are vital to treat anaphylactic shock?",
      "options": [
        "beta blockers",
        "Sympathomimetics",
        "ACE inhibitors",
        "Anticoagulants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Sympathomimetic drugs, such as adrenaline, are crucial because they counteract histamine-induced vasodilation. Its powerful vasoconstrictor effect helps to raise blood pressure quickly and systemically, which is vital in this emergency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hemorrhagic shock presents what nervous activation?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic activation",
        "No activation",
        "Maximum sympathetic activation",
        "reflex inhibition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Hemorrhagic shock, due to the decrease in blood volume, triggers circulatory reflexes that lead to maximum activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This seeks to compensate for the loss through peripheral vasoconstriction and an increase in heart rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do sympathomimetics have limited usefulness in hemorrhagic shock?",
      "options": [
        "They are vasodilators",
        "The body already uses them",
        "They have no effects",
        "They are very toxic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Sympathomimetic drugs have limited usefulness in hemorrhagic shock because the sympathetic nervous system is already maximally active due to compensatory circulatory reflexes. Adding more of these substances exogenously does not usually produce a significant additional effect."

    {
      "question": "What is the main characteristic of circulatory arrest?",

        "Very slow flow",
        "Flow completely interrupted",
        "Mild hypotension",
        "high venous pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Circulatory arrest represents a critical condition in which blood flow throughout the body is completely interrupted. This interruption can be a direct consequence of cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation, and requires immediate intervention."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a cause that can lead to circulatory arrest?",
      "options": [
        "ventricular fibrillation",
        "Sinus tachycardia",
        "mild bradycardia",
        "mitral stenosis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ventricular fibrillation is a serious arrhythmia where the heart loses its ability to pump blood effectively, resulting in the complete interruption of blood flow, this being one of the direct and frequent causes of total circulatory arrest."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is ventricular fibrillation stopped?",
      "options": [
        "Vagal stimulation",
        "Powerful electroshock",
        "Carotid massage",
        "Glucose administration"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that is stopped by immediately applying a powerful electroshock to the heart, a procedure known as defibrillation. Its goal is to depolarize cardiac cells and restore a normal and efficient sinus heart rhythm."
    },
    {
      "question": "After how many minutes of circulatory stop there is brain damage?",
      "options": [
        "More than 10 minutes",
        "Between 5 and 8 minutes",
        "At least 30 minutes",
        "less than 1 minute"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Complete interruption of blood flow for a period of more than five to eight minutes can cause at least some degree of brain damage. This is due to the high sensitivity of brain tissue to a lack of oxygen and nutrients, which underlines the urgency of resuscitation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What procedure is used to restore normal heart rhythm in arrest?",
      "options": [
        "Immediate catheterization",
        "cardiopulmonary resuscitation",
        "Air ventilation",
        "Blood collection"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving emergency procedure that combines chest compressions with ventilation. It is used to maintain a minimum of circulation and oxygen to the brain and heart after cardiac arrest, until an effective heart rhythm can be reestablished."
