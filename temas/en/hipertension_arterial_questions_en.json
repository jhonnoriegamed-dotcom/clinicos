      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The basic hemodynamic formula establishes that Blood Pressure (BP) is the product of Cardiac Output (CO), which is the volume of blood that the heart pumps per minute, multiplied by Peripheral Vascular Resistance (PVR), which is the opposition to blood flow in the vessels.

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "In established HTN, the central mechanism is the persistent increase in Peripheral Vascular Resistance (PVR).

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Nitric Oxide (NO) is the main vasodilator produced by the endothelium. In HTN, its bioavailability decreases due to its inactivation by oxidative stress (free radicals such as superoxide anion), which favors increased vascular tone and vasoconstriction."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Vascular remodeling is an irreversible structural change in the wall of resistance arterioles, which reduces their internal radius.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "According to Poiseuille's Law, resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius.

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme of the RAAS. Its function is to convert Angiotensin I, which is biologically inactive, into Angiotensin II (Ang II), which is a potent vasoconstrictor and trophic factor that promotes hypertrophy and vascular remodeling."

        "SNS activation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The main effect of Aldosterone, stimulated by Angiotensin II, is to increase the reabsorption of Sodium (Na^+) and water in the renal tubules. This results in the expansion of plasma volume, which contributes to increased Cardiac Output and elevated Blood Pressure."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Hyperactivity of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) releases catecholamines (norepinephrine and adrenaline). These stimulate the beta_1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, which causes an increase in heart rate and contraction force, thus increasing Cardiac Output."

      "options": [
        "More plasma volume",

        "Less sodium reabsorption",
        "Renin inhibition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In HBP, the Pressure-Nathiuresis curve is shifted to the right. This means that the kidney requires a significantly higher Blood Pressure (BP) than normal in order to excrete the necessary amount of Sodium (Na^+) and water to maintain balance, establishing a new higher 'set point'."
