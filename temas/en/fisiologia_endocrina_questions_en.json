        "Acetoacetic acid"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Growth hormone generates excessive mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue, which causes the liver to convert a large portion of these into acetoacetic acid, releasing it into the body fluids in high quantities and thus causing the metabolic state known as ketosis."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The effect of growth hormone in raising blood glucose requires a compensatory response by the pancreas, resulting in a noticeable increase in insulin secretion to try to manage and counteract the excess circulating glucose, although GH induces resistance to it."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "All effects of growth hormone on carbohydrate metabolism, such as reduced glucose uptake and increased hepatic production, are the result of the ability of this hormone to induce marked resistance to the biological action of insulin in sensitive peripheral tissues."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "By attenuating the effect of insulin, growth hormone prevents the efficient use and uptake of glucose by the tissues, while simultaneously promoting its hepatic production, which together causes a notable and persistent elevation of glucose concentration in the bloodstream."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Growth in length of long bones occurs in the epiphyseal cartilages, where the epiphyses are separated from the diaphyses. Growth hormone stimulates the deposition of cartilage, followed by its conversion into new bone, thus causing progressive lengthening of the shaft."

        "Disappearance of cartilage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "At the end of adolescence, the epiphyseal cartilage progressively disappears. When there is no additional cartilage left that can become bone, bone fusion occurs between the diaphysis and epiphysis, permanently stopping the growth in length of long bones."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "In toxic colloid goiter, or Graves' disease, the anterior pituitary is not suppressed normally due to the presence of immunoglobulins that stimulate the thyroid. This lack of suppression leads to thyroid follicles growing uncontrollably and the gland increasing in size."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Although the exact cause of idiopathic colloid goiter is not completely clear, one theory suggests that it is due to mild thyroiditis. This inflammation, although subtle, would cause slight hypothyroidism that triggers a compensatory increase in the hormone TSH."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Myxedema is the most severe form of hypothyroidism in adults and is characterized by the accumulation of hydrophilic substances in the subcutaneous tissue. This buildup causes edema that is typically hard and 'pitting', meaning it does not leave a mark when pressed, differentiating it from other types of edema."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The development of nodules in idiopathic colloid goiter reinforces the theory that the underlying cause is mild thyroiditis. These nodules usually form in portions of the gland that were not inflamed, but have grown excessively due to constant TSH stimulation."

        "Near cartilage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The deposition of new bone in the second mechanism of bone growth is carried out by osteoblasts located in the bone periosteum and in various bone cavities. This occurs on the surface of the old bone, contributing to its increase in thickness and overall remodeling."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In toxic colloid goiter, characterized by severe hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland experiences a very considerable increase in size. This excessive growth can cause the gland to enlarge between 10 and 20 times its normal size."

        "HRT"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "In non-toxic idiopathic colloid goiter, although the gland is enlarged, the secretion of thyroid hormone, such as thyroxine (T_4) and triiodothyronine (T_3), is usually depressed. This is because mild thyroiditis causes partial insufficiency, which in turn raises TSH."

        "Decreases cartilage deposit",
        "It completely calcifies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The growth of long bones ceases when the epiphyseal cartilage disappears and is replaced by bone, causing bone fusion between the diaphysis and the epiphysis. This process is responsible for stopping the increase in the length of the long bones at the end of adolescence."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "It has been suggested that mild thyroiditis is responsible for the mild hypothyroidism in idiopathic colloid goiter. This chronic and subtle inflammation of the thyroid gland affects its functional capacity, leading to slightly insufficient production of thyroid hormone, which triggers TSH."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Non-toxic idiopathic colloid goiter presents large thyroid glands, similar to those seen in endemic colloid goiter. The fundamental difference is that idiopathic goiter occurs in people who do not suffer from iodine deficiencies in their diet."

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Dental plaque is essentially a large buildup of bacteria that adheres to the surface of your teeth. These bacteria are responsible for starting the cavity process by metabolizing sugars."

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The bacteria in dental plaque rely heavily on carbohydrates for nutrition. When available, they activate their metabolism and proliferate rapidly, producing harmful byproducts."

        "Organic bases.",
        "Carbon dioxide."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Acids, such as lactic acid, are the main factor that causes cavities. These acids slowly dissolve the calcium salts in the tooth, starting the demineralization process in the tooth structure."

      "options": [
        "The fluorine.",

        "Proteolytic enzymes.",
        "Calcium ions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Once the acids have dissolved the calcium salts in the tooth, the organic matrix that is exposed is attacked and degraded by proteolytic enzymes that are also produced by the bacteria in dental plaque."

      "question": "Which tooth structure is most resistant to demineralization by acids?",
      "options": [

        "The dental pulp.",
        "Tooth enamel."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Tooth enamel is the first and most resistant barrier against cavities. Its dense crystalline structure makes it much less susceptible to dissolution by acids compared to the underlying dentin."

    {
      "question": "Why is enamel more resistant to acids than dentin?",
      "options": [
        "It has a high organic content.",
        "Its crystals are large and dense.",
        "It has blood vessels.",
        "Its color is white."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The high resistance of enamel is due to the fact that its crystals are much denser. Each enamel crystal has a volume that is about 200 times larger than dentin crystal, making it less porous."
